                figures in the Dog Park—but not for long, as there are now plans to reinforce the fence around the Dog
                Park." — Mayor Dana Cardinal

        <h1>Dog Park Policy Changes</h1>
        <p>The Dog Park was never intended for public use by dogs or humans, and even
            acknowledging the existence of The Dog Park is illegal. But, after the recent outcry, the City Council has
            decided to make a policy change.
        </p>
        <p>Night Vale citizens can now apply to let Hooded Figures play with their dog in The Dog Park. However, the dog
            owners will be packed away in styrofoam containers for the duration.
