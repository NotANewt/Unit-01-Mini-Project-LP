# Unit-01-Mini-Project-LP

Created a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information.
To add some design flavor, I created a landing page for a location from the podcast "Night Vale".  
The landing page has a header and footer, an image with a caption with a descriptive 'alt' attribute, and a contact form.
The landing page has a polished and accesible UI.
The page uses semantic HTML elements and at least two heading elements.
The page uses universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.
The page features at least three colors in the design, uses a single font and font family for all text.
The header is fixed to the top of the page on scroll, and contains a navigation bar with three links that display inline, including a contact link.
When the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.
The contact form includes `input` elements for name and email, as well as a Send button.
